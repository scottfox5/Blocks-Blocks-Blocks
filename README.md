#Blocks Blocks Blocks

##Scott Fox

In this project, I created a button, and each time it is clicked a box is created.

Those boxes are displayed horizontally.

When each box is clicked it turns black.

When the box is initially created, it will be one of six randomly generated colors.

Each box has its own button with an x on it. When clicked, the box will be removed.
